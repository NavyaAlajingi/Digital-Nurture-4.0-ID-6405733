Use Linear Search:
- When the dataset is small or frequently changing
- When sorting is not possible or not worth the effort
- For simple one-time searches

Use Binary Search:
- When working with large, sorted datasets
- For read-heavy applications where search speed matters
- Only after ensuring the data is sorted (e.g., using indexes or TreeMap)

Bonus:
- For ultra-fast lookups by ID â†’ consider using HashMap (O(1) time)
