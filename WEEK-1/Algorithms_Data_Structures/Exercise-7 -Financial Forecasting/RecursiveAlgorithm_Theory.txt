Understanding Recursive Algorithms:

Recursion is a technique where a method calls itself to solve a smaller version of the original problem. 
It is especially useful in problems that have a clear repetitive structure, like financial forecasting, factorials, tree traversals, etc.

In this example, the future value of money is calculated recursively:
- Base Case: If years = 0, return the initial amount.
- Recursive Case: FV = previous year's amount × (1 + growthRate)

Time Complexity:
- Recursive function runs once for each year → O(n), where n = number of years.

Optimization:
- If future values are requested repeatedly (for multiple years), store results using memoization to avoid recalculating.
- Alternatively, use an iterative version for better space efficiency (no stack calls).
