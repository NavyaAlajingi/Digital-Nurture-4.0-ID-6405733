Use Case:
To predict future investment value based on consistent annual growth.

Recursive Formula:
FV(n) = FV(n-1) Ã— (1 + r)

Where:
- FV = Future Value
- r = growth rate
- n = number of years

Suitable for:
- Small to medium year ranges
- Simple growth forecasting

Not suitable for:
- Large year values (due to stack overflow risk)
- Dynamic or varying growth rates

Recommendation:
1. Use recursion for educational clarity or small-scale apps
2. Use loop/memoization for production-level systems
